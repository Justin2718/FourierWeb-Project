		 In simple terms, the Fourier Series is a mathematical technique that involves 
		 combining different waves to create any type of continuous function. 
		 This method was originally developed by Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier in 
		 1807 as a tool to solve differential equations related to heat conduction. 
		 By representing complex functions as a sum of simpler waves, the Fourier 
		 Series provides a powerful method for analyzing and manipulating various 
		 signals in fields such as mathematics, physics, nd engineering.

	The symbol that resembles a weird "E" is a Riemann sum, which you can interpret as a loop. 
	The upper and lower limits of the loop denote the starting and ending values of the index 
	variable "n," which starts at 1. Think of the "E" as an update that occurs within each 
	iteration of the loop. The upper limit of the loop is infinity, which serves as the stopping 
	condition.

	It is also important to note that "L" represents the length of the function being recreated. 
	A0, An, and Bn are simply terms that mathematicians use to simplify equations for easier 
	notation. Think of them as methods. The equations for each method will be shown below.

	The first simplification in the Fourier Series equation involves the constant term, which 
	is denoted by "a0." To better understand this, consider the equation y = mx + c. Here, "a0" 
	corresponds to the constant term "c," which determines the vertical shift of the function. 
	The value of "a0" is dependent on the average value of the function over the period length 
	that you select, which can either shift the function up or down.

	The second simplification of the Fourier Series equation is closely related to the third 
	simplification, so I'll be explaing both of them at the same time. To better understand 
	this, consider the analogy of mixing paint. In this case, the cosine wave can be thought 
	of as black paint, while the sine wave is white paint. Every possible function can be 
	represented as a shade of gray, and by combining sine and cosine waves, you can create 
	any shade of gray.
	<br></br>
	It's important to note that certain functions will have a stronger resemblance to cosine 
	waves than sine waves, and vice versa. The second, and third simplification is about 
	breaking down the function into its individual components of sine and cosine waves, which 
	allows you to accurately represent it as a combination of different shades of gray.

	Now we can animate waves by having a line thatis constant length while it's angle changes 
	and plot it's x postion along time which will produce a cosin wave while plotting it's y 
	postion over time will produce a sin wave.
